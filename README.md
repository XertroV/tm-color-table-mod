# Color Table Customizer

Customize the game's color tables! Your choices will be saved and persisted.

If/when Color Tables in map mods is fixed, you'll find this plugin saves ColorTable.gbx.json files in the same format as the game, so they are ready for copying into a mod.

Each row in each color table has 5 colors; for normal track borders (TM_Race), these correspond to: White, Green, Blue, Red, Black.

Each color table has 4 rows:

* Colors
* Colors_Blind
* TM_Stunt
* TM_Stunt_Blind

There are 10 color tables total:

* Sport (track borders)
* SportIllum (track lights)
* SportDecals (decals on blocks)
* SportDecals2 (more decals on blocks)
* SportObstacles (poles and things)
* TrackWall (wood track walls)
* Canopy (used on canopy blocks)
* CanopyLights
* CanopyStructure
* Fun (plastic / royal)
